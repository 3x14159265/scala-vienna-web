This is the [Play](http://www.playframework.com) application that shall power tomorrow's Scala Vienna User Group website!

## Getting started

- grab and install [Play](http://www.playframework.com)
- install the [Chrome tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-framework-tools/dchhggpgbommpcjpogaploblnpldbmen) to get the auto-reloading benefits
- run Play with `play ~ run` to enable continuous reloading during development

## TODO

- Install bootstrap using WebJars
- Meetup integration
- Twitter integration

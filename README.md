# Scala Vienna Web

This is the [Play](http://www.playframework.com) application that shall power tomorrow's Scala Vienna User Group website!

## Getting started

- grab and install [Play](http://www.playframework.com)
- install the [Chrome tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/play-framework-tools/dchhggpgbommpcjpogaploblnpldbmen) to get the auto-reloading benefits
- run Play with `play ~ run` to enable continuous reloading during development
- Since we are all working on the same repo, make sure you [do a pull with rebase](http://gitready.com/advanced/2009/02/11/pull-with-rebase.html)  when updating your local repo!

## TODO

- Meetup integration
- Twitter integration

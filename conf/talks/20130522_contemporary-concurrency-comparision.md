I shall try to give a succinct explanation and critical comparison of the defining architectural principles and coding styles in Akka Actors, Scala 2.10 (previously Akka) Futures and Java EE 6 Enterprise JavaBeans (in particular JMS MDBs and session beans with asynchronous business methods). Although Akka has a Java binding and Java EE is, obviously, a Java standard, this comparison will focus on usage from (and code in) Scala.
